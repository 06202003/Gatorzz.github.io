# Ecommerce-Appearance-Project
Project UAS - WebDasar IN211

We use HTML, CSS, Javascript, and PHP as tools to create the web.
We also use Bootstrap framework to create responsive web pages.
We don't use a database, because our focus is on creating responsive page views with some javascript features.
